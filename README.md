My name is Lucy Stedman. I'm a senior in Graphic Design at the UMN. Here are three fun facts about me:
  1. I was born in Minnesota but lived in central Florida for about 10 years when I was little.
  2. Fitness is my hobby. I love weight lifting and pilates.
  3. My family and I have five cats and two dogs!
